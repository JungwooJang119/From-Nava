  - "INTERVIEW RECORDING - DR. TAYLOR GREENE  [BEGIN LOG: 10:16 AM]  Dr. Greene clears
    her throat.  Dr. Greene: \u201C...hello! How have you been holding up?\u201D 
    The subject is silent. Dr. Greene scribbles something down on her clipboard quietly
    and continues.  Dr. Greene: \u201CThat\u2019s quite alright, you don\u2019t have
    to say anything. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot recently. It\u2019s been
    so hectic and uncomfortable for you since we found you, and I can imagine how
    tired you must be. Does that sound right?\u201D "
  - "he subject is silent. Dr. Greene waits for a few seconds, and then goes on. 
    Dr. Greene: \u201CFirst, I want you to know that all of us here at Nava Labs,
    all of us, want to help you as best we can. We all want you to be safe, and we
    all want you to be as comfortable and as happy as possible. So, if you would
    like anything at all, or if you really just don\u2019t want to talk right now,
    don\u2019t be afraid to ask. We all are here for you. Does that sound okay?\u201D"
  - "The subject is silent, but there is the sound of shuffling feet, and Dr. Greene
    quickly writes something down on her clipboard.  Dr. Greene: \u201CThank you.
    Would you be alright with talking with me for a little bit? You won\u2019t need
    to speak if you aren\u2019t comfortable.\u201D  The subject is silent. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CExcellent. Thank you! And again, if at any point you need
    anything, just let me know. Before we start, would you like some water?\u201D 
    The subject is silent.  Dr. Greene: \u201CAre you sure? No worries. So, before
    I\u2013\u201D  Dr. Greene is cut off with a brief fit of coughing. She then mutters
    something inaudible to another scientist in the room, and there is the sound
    of the door opening and closing. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CAh, sorry about that. Anyways...I wanted to ask, before we
    get started, do you have a name? You don\u2019t need to say it, just nod yes
    or no.\u201D   The subject is silent. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CAnd, if I gave you a pen, would you be able to write it down?\u201D 
    The subject is silent. Dr. Greene lets out a small cough and clears her throat
    again.  Dr. Greene: \u201CThat\u2019s quite alright. Actually, about a pen: that
    pen in your hands isn\u2019t like any pen I\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s quite\u2026
    pretty, though. Is that pen important to you?\u201D "
  - "The subject is silent. Dr. Greene adjusts her chair and there is the sound of
    her writing, much slower this time. She stops.   Dr. Greene: \u201CI see. And,
    was the pen given to you by anyone?\u201D  The subject is silent. There is the
    sound of the door opening and footsteps. Dr. Greene says a thank you quietly,
    and the door closes. Dr. Greene takes a long sip, and puts a glass down on the
    table. She clears her throat again. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CUh, and\u2026 sorry, tell me again: Did anyone give you the
    pen?\u201D  The subject is silent. Dr. Greene begins taking a long sip. She coughs
    into the drink, and there is the sound of a glass falling to the ground and shattering
    as Dr. Greene struggles to regain her composure through a much heavier fit of
    coughing. She stands up, and her chair clatters to the ground behind her. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CAh, shoot. Sorry, I just\u2026 I just spit all over you, didn\u2019t
    I? I\u2019m sorry. Are you\u2026 wow, isn\u2019t it hot in here? No, don\u2019t
    worry about cleaning anything\u2026 cleaning anything up, we can just continue
    for now. Sorry about that. Uh, so\u2026\u201D  The subject is silent. Dr. Greene
    picks up her chair, and takes another seat. She scribbles for a minute on her
    clipboard. She clears her throat. "
  - "Dr. Greene: \u201CSo\u2026 do you remember exactly\u2026 sorry, I can\u2019t
    even read what I\u2026 what I wrote down! Isn\u2019t that funny? Tell me\u2026
    tell me one more time, did anyone give you the pen? Did anyone give you the pen?\u201D"
  - The subject is silent. The door to the room opens, and a few sets of footsteps
    walk in. Dr. Greene turns and begins to say something to them, but is interrupted
    by another fit of coughing, and after a few seconds a guttural sound begins to
    come from her throat, something between retching and screaming, and her chair
    clatters to the floor again as Dr. Greene falls to the floor. The subject is
    silent.
  - Something begins to work its way up through Dr. Greene, something heavy and wet
    that comes from her stomach and pinches her throat and falls onto the ground.
    Dr. Greene grabs onto the wall and tries to pull herself up, but she falls. The
    footsteps in the room are now panicked and erratic. Now, Dr. Greene begins to
    scream.
  - "There is the sound of something ancient and deadly in her scream, a banshee\u2019s
    wail, and Dr. Greene no longer sounds like a human. There are screams, much more
    human screams, from those watching, but the subject is silent. And Dr. Greene
    now lurches out of the room and into the hallway, but it is not footsteps she
    makes but an unearthly slimy squelching, as if she is melting into nothing."
