  - A brief overview of the greater biological testing scheme approved on [REDACTED]
    are contained in this report. Some testing awaits results, and raw data may be
    accessed at the request of Dr. Moore.
  - "In most respects, the anatomy of the subject closely mirrors that of human anatomy,
    and early samples of skin and blood that resembled human biology have been verified
    by further deep tissue samples. The subject\u2019s blood is that of AB+, and
    bone samples taken from the hip indicate a bone age of about 12-16 years. "
  - 'Of most concern, and the basis of the testing plan, is to determine the source
    of the mild beta radiation on the order of 13 mSv on the surface skin of the
    subject. Endoscopy and colonoscopy tests measuring radiation inside the subject
    found no evidence of ingestion of radioactive material, and radiation flux did
    not increase appreciably inside the subject, implying that it is a surface borne
    phenomenon. '
  - "Biopsy specimens from the skin, lung, colon, and thyroid found no evidence of
    radiation burn or other adverse effects that would be expected on a human-like
    anatomy. In addition, specimens separated from the main subject\u2019s body as
    a whole were not sources of radiation."
  - An important result is that as the Pen is brought closer to the subject, the
    radiation flux increases, to about a maximum of 30 mSv when a few meters away
    from the subject. The Pen itself is not radioactive. It is unknown the extent
    to which this phenomenon affects the subject or the Pen, and so it is imperative
    to store the Pen and subject separately, and to seal the Pen, while testing continues.
  - 'Testing on the cerebrospinal fluid of the subject is awaiting results. Testing
    on spinal samples of the subject is awaiting results.  Analysis of stereotactic
    brain biopsy tissue is awaiting results. '
